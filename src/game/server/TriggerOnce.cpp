/*QUAKED trigger_once (.5 .5 .5) ? notouch
Variable sized trigger. Triggers once, then removes itself.  You must set the key "target" to the name of another object in the level that has a matching
"targetname".  If "health" is set, the trigger must be killed to activate.
If notouch is set, the trigger is only fired by other entities, not by touching.
if "killtarget" is set, any objects that have a matching "target" will be removed when the trigger is fired.
if "angle" is set, the trigger will only fire when someone is facing the direction of the angle.  Use "360" for an angle of 0.

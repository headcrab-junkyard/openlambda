/*QUAKED trigger_counter (.5 .5 .5) ? nomessage
Acts as an intermediary for an action that takes multiple inputs.

If nomessage is not set, t will print "1 more.. " etc when triggered and "sequence complete" when finished.

After the counter has been triggered "count" times (default 2), it will fire all of it's targets and remove itself.
